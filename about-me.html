    <p> This is my bestfriend Narem! I adopted her out of our trash when she was just a tiny kitten. She and her sibling were just your run of the mill trailer litter and after we had our first terible snow in Minot I decieded the next time I heard them digging in our trash I was going to try and scoop them up and Narem has lived with me ever since :)</p>
